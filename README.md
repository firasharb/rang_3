Giving new meaning to Home Security

----------------------------------------------------

This is the Repository for the Rang project in CMPS 253.
The concept of the project is a smart doorbell that when clicked provides a picture of the person at the door.
The reason for this is to increase the security in ones home, and give them a sense of confidence and security.
